NB! THE APP WILL NOT TRANSLATE OUT OF THE BOX

Required Setup:  
In order to use the application you would need to replace the Base_URL and API_KEY within the [Constants object](https://github.com/mmilenkov/Translator/blob/master/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/selostudios/translator/Constants.kt) with those of your actual api,
which is your own version of [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/).
